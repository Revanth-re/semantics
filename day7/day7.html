<center><h1>FULLSTACK DEVELOPMENT</h1></center>
<p>
    <b>Frontend:</b>Frontend is used to view or collect the data.
we use HTML& CSS to showcase our data
we use javascript to collect data from the user.<br>
<b>Backend:</b>Backend is mostly deals with the logical part of the Application.
it deals with the Apis and server part it takes requests from user and sends response to the client. and also it integrates with database.<br>
<b>Database:</b>Database deals with the data it stores the data from which was given by user and validates the data.and also it manipulates the data.<br><br>
<center> <h1>why we only stores the data in the database ??</h1></center>
Because of database provides security and data manipulations to the data.
And it provides accessibility to any server.<br>
<center> <h1>Why dont we store data in the local storage??</h1></center> 
if we store the data in the local storage it cant be accessible to the servers.
only we can access data in our computer only.<br>
<Center><h1>why dont we store data in the server??</h1></Center>
if we store the data in the server it takes more time to procces the application it slows downs the performance of application<br><br><br>

    <b>1. Front-End Development (Client-side)</b>
This is the part of the application that users interact with directly. Front-end developers create the visual aspects of a website or application.<br><br>
Technologies:
<b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</b> Structure of web pages.<br>
<b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</b> Layout and styling of web pages.<br>
<b>JavaScript:</b>Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.<br>
<b>Frontend Frameworks/Libraries:</b> React, Angular, Vue.js,<br><br>
<b>2. Back-End Development (Server-side)</b>
This is the part of the application that manages and serves data. Back-end developers create the logic, databases, and server-side infrastructure that make the web application run.<br>
Technologies:
Programming languages: Node.js (JavaScript), Python (Django, Flask), Ruby (Rails), PHP, Java (Spring), C# (.NET)<br><br>
<b>3.Database</b><br>
A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It is designed to store data in a structured way so that it can be retrieved, updated, or manipulated efficiently. <br>
<b>Relational Databases (RDBMS):</b><br>
Store data in structured tables with predefined relationships between them<br>
MySQL<br>

1.Oracle Database<br>
2.NoSQL Databases:<br>
3.NOsql Database:<br>
<strong>semi-structured data:</strong><br>
1.MongoDB (Document-based)<br>
2.Cassandra (Column-family based)<br><br>

<b>4. DevOps and Deployment</b><br>
Full-stack developers often work with DevOps tools and practices to deploy and maintain applications.<br>

<b>Server</b><br>
A server is a computer, device, or software program that provides services, resources, or data to other computers, known as clients, over a network. Servers are typically more powerful and have greater storage and processing capacity than client devices<br>
<b>Client</b><br>
A client is a computer, device, or software program that makes requests to a server for resources, data, or services. The client usually interacts directly with the end-user and displays data received from the server.<br>
<b>What is an API?<br>
An API (Application Programming Interface):</b> is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. It defines how different software components should communicate and exchange data, often between a client and a server.
In simpler terms, an API is like a messenger that takes requests from the client (e.g., a web browser or mobile app) to the server, processes the request, and returns the response back to the client.<br>
<b>What is DNS Lookup?</b><br>
DNS (Domain Name System) lookup is the process of translating a human-readable domain name (like www.example.com) into its corresponding IP address (such as 192.0.2.1). The DNS system is crucial for navigating the internet, as it enables devices to locate and connect to web servers using domain names instead of numerical IP addresses.<br>
<b>Browser:</b><br>
A browser (or web browser) is a software application that allows users to access, retrieve, and view content on the World Wide Web (WWW). It interprets and displays the data found on websites, allowing users to interact with text, images, videos, and other resources.<br>
<b>Local storage</b><br>
Local Storage is a web storage feature provided by web browsers that allows websites to store data locally on a user's device, within the browser, in a key-value pairs <br>

    <center><h1>How Actually 3 Tier Architecture Works</h1></center>

    <i><b>
       
        <center></center><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/login-form-design-04.jpg" alt ="no image" height="100%" width=100%></center>
    1. Here basically we have three tiers called frontend , backend,database <br>
    2.n here we used Register and login page to know how the architecture works<br>
    3.We used technologies like Html ,Css&javascript.<br>
    4.Html is used for showcasing the content and javascript is used to collect and send the content to the server..<br>
    5.Node js is worked as backend logic and mysql is worked as a datastorage..<br>
    6.So the Main thing is We have a register page and it is used tu enter the details of a user like...Username password and other details..<br>
    7.after clicking the register button The data will be sent to the server or backend through APIs ..<br>
    8.After that The data wil be checked or validated with the select query...<br>
    <mark> select *where username="username"</mark><br>
    9.After that if the User name is existed it will sends a respone like username is already exists try another one..<br>
    10Else it shows a message like registration successfull and navigates to the login page..<br>
    11.After that continuing with the login page in this form it have two insert values like Username and password..<br>
    12.if We entered the correct details it will checks or validates the data and shows a message like login succesfull it will navigates to the homepage..<br>
    13.Else it will shows the message like password incorrect..<br>
    14Here in Nodejs we have to write logic for Register and login to Take request and Responses..<br>
    15.Nodejs takes Response from register button,and mysql validates the data in the database and its response accordingly trough the user interaction..</b><br>

    <h1> Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):</h1>
    <b>Definition:</b>SDLC refers to the series of phases or stages that software developers follow to design, develop, test, and maintain software applications.<br>
    <b>Planning/Requirement:</b>Definition: The initial phase where the project's scope, objectives, and requirements are defined. During this stage, business needs are assessed, and the software requirements .<br>
    <b>System Design:.</b>Definition: This phase involves creating detailed blueprints for the software..<br>
    
    <b>Development (Implementation):</b> Definition: This is the phase where the actual coding or programming takes place. .<br>
    <b>Testing: .</b>Definition: In this phase, the developed software is tested to ensure that it functions as expected and meets the original requirements. This includes different levels of testing such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing..<br>
    <b>Deployment:</b> Definition: After successful testing, the software is deployed to the production environment, making it available for end-users. .<br>
    <b>Maintenance: </b>Definition: This phase involves ongoing support and improvements for the software after it has been deployed.<br>
    
    
    <h1>Web Application.</h1><br>
    A web application is software that runs on a web server and is accessed by users through a web browser, typically over the internet. It doesn’t require installation on the user’s device, as it’s run in a browser, and updates are handled centrally on the server..<br>
    <b>Examples:</b><br>
    
    <pre>
    1.instagram
    2.whatsaap
    3.snapchat
    4.netflix
    5.github
    6.Threads
    </pre>
    <h1>Standalone Application</h1><br>
    A standalone application is software that runs directly on a user's local device, such as a personal computer, smartphone, or tablet. It doesn't rely on a server or internet connection to function <br>
    <pre>
    examples:
    1.Notepad
    2.Camera
    3.Gallery
    4.MSword
    5.Calculator
    6.Share me
